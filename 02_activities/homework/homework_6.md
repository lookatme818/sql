**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my experience as a data analyst in Cornershop accounting team, I now recognize the significance of incorporating ethical considerations and addressing inequity in my analytical work. My responsibilities involved analyzing financial data, ensuring reporting accuracy, and providing insights to support strategic decision-making. While technical expertise was crucial, understanding the broader impact of my analyses was equally important.

Ethics played a key role in maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. As I had access to sensitive financial information, it was essential to handle this data with care. Ensuring that my analyses were both accurate and unbiased was a fundamental aspect of my role, as errors or misrepresentations could lead to flawed business decisions and negatively affect stakeholders. Reflecting on this, I now understand that being transparent about my methods and assumptions is just as vital as the precision of the results.

Regarding inequity, my work involved analyzing data that could shape resource allocation within the organization. I now realize that data-driven decisions have the potential to either reinforce or reduce inequities. For instance, if my analysis showed higher revenue growth in certain geographic regions or customer segments, it could result in more resources being allocated to those areas. However, this approach could unintentionally widen the gap between high-performing and low-performing regions or demographics, leaving some groups underserved. Moving forward, I would ensure that my analyses not only highlight areas of high revenue but also consider factors such as market potential and access barriers. This would involve examining customer demographics and market conditions to identify if certain regions or groups are underrepresented due to systemic barriers, rather than a lack of demand, thus supporting a more equitable allocation of resources.
